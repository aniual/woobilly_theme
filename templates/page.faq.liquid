First, check the area where the carrier might have left the package and ask your neighbors in case it was delivered to the wrong address. Also, look for any 'attempted delivery' notices, which may indicate the carrier tried to deliver but no one was home. If you still can’t find it, wait until the end of the next day, as some carriers may mark packages as delivered even when they’re still in transit.
If you still don’t have your package, contact the carrier with your tracking number for more details. If the carrier cannot resolve the issue, please reach out to our Customer Care Center at contact@woobilly.com.

                               • We accept exchanges and returns within 30 days of receipt. Free gifts, underwear, and items marked as final sale are not eligible for return.
                              • Items must be returned in their original condition—unworn, unwashed, with all tags and liners attached.
                              • We kindly ask that you try on items without wearing makeup, perfume, or beauty products that could leave marks or scents, as this may make the item non-returnable.
                              • Please wear underwear when trying on your purchase, as we reserve the right to refuse returns that show signs of wear.
                              • Exchanges:    
                              - We are happy to offer free exchanges, and for your first exchange, Shapellx will provide a complimentary return label.
                              - However, for any subsequent exchanges, customers will be responsible for the associated shipping costs.
                              • Returns and Refunds:    
                              If a customer decides to return an item for a refund, please be aware that Woobilly does not cover the cost of return shipping.
                              * In most instances, we can only process one return or exchange per order. To ensure a smooth process, please carefully consider all the items you wish to return.

           To the extent that we are required by law to charge and collect taxes on products that we sell, such taxes are charged based on the tax laws applicable to the location to which the order is being shipped or delivered. At checkout, all appropriate taxes will be added to the order total. The tax amount displayed during checkout is an estimate of the tax applicable to your order. This amount may vary slightly from the actual amount of tax payable in connection with your order due to different tax rates which apply as a result of the origin and destination of the item(s) being purchased, as well as other factors.
